# L-mode and R-mode

-   The first CPU is a slow, linear, traditional Von Neumann architecture. Instructions are processed one after another in order.

-   The second CPU is a digital signal processor that searches and pattern match asynchronously. It can magically find links between unrelated things, but you have no control over it.

They share the same memory bus, so if one is working, the other isn’t. If the first CPU is executing instructions, the second isn’t asynchronously searching, and vice versa.

The first CPU is called L-mode, where the L stands for `linear`. The second CPU is called R-mode, where the `R stands for the rich creative `

You need both of these modes. R-mode helps you innovate, come up with new ideas and connections, and breakthrough walls. L-mode lets you execute the details.

-   Remember that time you magically came up with the solution to a programming problem while you were having a shower? That was R-mode. Then, when you got to work, you sat down and wrote each sequential line of code to implement it? That’s L-mode

# Concept of radical candor via Quadrant.

-   Radical candor is what happens when you personally care and challenge others directly. You say what you think and deliver the feedback precisely but in such a way that ensures the recipient sees that you are doing so because you care. This is where you want to be. It promotes trust and growth.

<!-- The Best is Radical candor -->

-   Ruinous empathy happens when you care but don’t challenge directly. It’s either unspecific praise or diluted criticism to avoid a difficult message. This doesn’t help the recipient improve.

-   Obnoxious aggression is when you challenge but don’t care. It’s insincere praise or mean criticism.

-   Manipulative insincerity is when you do neither. Good behaviors go unpraised, and bad behaviors are ignored.

# Traits to avoid

-   Overcommunication: Saying the same thing over and over again is inefficient and can frustrate other people. If you find yourself having to communicate the same thing repeatedly, why is that happening? Should that information be captured more formally in an email? Is there something wrong with your delivery that is making the message not stick?

-   Waffling: We’ve all observed politicians in interviews avoiding questions by talking, and talking, and talking. Don’t waffle. If you don’t want to answer a question or you don’t know the answer, just say so.

-   Playing to the crowd: Nobody wants a manager who does whatever it takes to please them, since whatever it takes is typically hiding information, sugar coating it, or downright lying. Say it like it is, even if it’s bad news.

-   Inconsistency: Ensure that you’re being the same person to everyone and that your message remains consistent with everyone. If you’re flip-flopping with decisions, you’ve probably communicated them too early.

-   Letting emotion get in the way: If you find yourself getting emotionally charged, angry, or frustrated, be open about how you feel. Reschedule meetings if you need to. Just don’t take it out on other people or let it cloud your judgment.

# Relationship with your manager

-At the beginning of your relationship with your manager, you should talk about performance. Notably, there are two areas to explore:

-   What does your performance equate to in the eyes of your manager? Is it the retention and happiness of your staff, the amount of work that you get done on time, some strict uptime SLAs, or is it entirely subjective?

-   What is their performance dependent upon? You can begin to get a view into the wider organization. Are they fundamentally accountable for everything that their teams ship, or are they accountable for more abstract business metrics? Do they even know?

The questions themselves can be straightforward and worked into your conversation:

“What’s been on your mind this week?”

“What’s your biggest worry at the moment?”

“How are your other staff doing?”

“What are your peers working on?”

# Four Ps for writing summaries

-   Progress: What has happened since the last time you wrote?

-   Problems: What issues have occurred and what needs addressing?

-   Plans: How are you going to approach those issues going forward?

-   People: How are the individuals on the team? Are they doing well or are they having a hard time? What could be improved?

# Normalizing your first one-on-one meeting

there’s a useful exercise that you can both follow that allows both parties to openly talk about what they expect from one another and outline their wants and needs from the relationship. This exercise is called contracting,

-   Contracting

Let’s have a look at each of the questions.

-   Which areas would you like the most support with?

-   How would you like to receive feedback and support?

-   What could be a challenge for us working together?

-   How should we gauge the effectiveness of my support?

-   How confidential is the content of our meetings?

# What to Talk About and How to Do It

First off, it’s essential that you prepare

-   Observations from the past week, either about their work or the team’s: These can be good or bad observations or even just areas where I’d like to probe a bit to find out more.

-   A deep dive into a project or piece of architecture that they’re working on

-   Updates that will be interesting for my staff, such as what has gone on recently in any other meetings that I’m part of or anything my own manager has told me, such as relevant things discussed at the last board meeting.

# It’s their meeting, not yours

What this means is that you must “keep the thought bubble over their head” for as much of the meeting as possible. Do this by asking leading questions, nudging the conversation in particular directions, and most of all, by listening.

Ask another question and let them arrive at a conclusion themselves

-   Here are some examples of helpful leading questions:

-   How has your work been going this week?

-   What are you working on today?

-   Tell me about those production issues we had last week.

-   Do you think that we’re measuring our uptime well enough?

-   How are you feeling about our deadline in June?

-   How best could we ensure that we’ve got all of the right metrics being logged ahead of time?

You can make updates more interesting by being creative. Instead of just nodding and listening to what they’ve been doing, why not probe deeper by asking some questions?

How could we deploy that into production quicker?

Have you seen any open source software that could solve that problem for us?

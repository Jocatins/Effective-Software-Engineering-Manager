# Making Introductions

Introduction email

Hello,

Apologies for emailing out of the blue. I’m X, and I manage the Y engineering team. We’re working on Z.

I’m hoping to frequently check in with others within the business to extend another hand outward from Engineering. If you’re receiving this, I’d love to know whether there is anything that I can help with or discuss!

Here’s a starter to get the conversation flowing:

Do you feel that there is anything we can do to improve our communication outside of the department, notably on what we’re planning, working on, and shipping?
Is there anything pressing that you would like more information on or any issues you’d like to raise?
What could we do better as a whole?
Additionally, are there any projects or discussions that could use my input? If you don’t reply, that’s not a problem; I’ll just assume that everything’s going well right now.
Best,

The Intelligent Reader of This Book.

You can replace the questions with anything that you feel is a current hot topic or of interest to you, so take the ones above as examples only. Some other questions that you could ask could be:

-   What they think of the most recent project that your team worked on

-   What their favorite feature or recent improvement is

-   What their dream feature would be (although, do make it clear you’re not just going to go off and build it…)

-   What their favorite software is and why

-   Who they look up to or have learned a lot from at work

# Checking in regularly

Once you have a list of folks that you’ve created an initial connection with, it’s up to you to decide how you would like to interact with them. You have options for the regularity and formality of your check-ins.

# Mentoring and coaching

-   Mentoring is where you can provide specific advice and teach certain skills to somebody.
-   Coaching is where you help others explore problems and come to their own solutions.

# What is mentoring

Mentoring is a relationship in which one person shares their experience, skills, and knowledge with another person in order for them to progress in their career. Mentoring relationships typically last for months or years, with the mentor becoming an accessible point of contact for the mentee. Sometimes, a mentorship can last for a whole career.

This means that the relationship has the following structure:

-   Regular meetings
-   An environment of encouragement and empowerment
-   A focus on achieving goals

# Benefits of mentoring

-   It allows you to develop your skills as a manager, even if you’re not managing the individual.
-   You get to increase your impact within your company as a positive contributor who is willing to help others, even if they are on other teams.
-   You’ll learn about the kinds of challenges that people are facing in other teams.
-   You’ll get to know other people that might even want to come and work on your team in the future.
-   Most importantly, it’s extremely rewarding, and it will make you feel like you’re making a real difference.

For the mentee, there are plenty of benefits also:

-   They can learn new skills and knowledge.
-   They can widen their network with the company by having a close relationship with somebody outside of their team.
-   They can use their mentor as an impartial third party because they’re not talking to somebody who is accountable for their performance or their pay.
-   They can use their mentor to gain distance from their day-to-day work and approach problems more abstractly.

# What is coaching?

At an abstract level, it’s a technique for helping your staff improve their performance. Since that sentence is so lofty, it almost means nothing. My own take on coaching is that it’s a framework for interactions with your colleagues that makes them more likely to have tangible positive effects on their work.

# Modes of conversation

-   Directive: This is where you’re instructing someone on what they should do. This is considered to be a “push” action, meaning you’re solving their problem for them.

-   Following interest: Here, you’re predominantly listening to understand, reflecting on what they are saying and summarizing. This is a “pull” action, meaning you’re helping them solve their own problems.

# Spies and Gatekeepers

-   Learn how you fit into the roles of spy and gatekeeper for your company

we can highlight some important points:

-   We should never attempt to obtain information without the permission of the information holder.

-   We should never attempt to obtain information for the benefit of another party.

-   We should never attempt to obtain information using deceitful means.

As a manager, you need to act as a gatekeeper. You have to:

-   Decide what parties should hear information.

-   Decide when that information should be shared.

-   Decide how that information should be framed.

there are two rules that you should abide by when it comes to dealing with all information. Both are simple, and both have been around longer than weâ€™ve been on this planet.

-   The Hippocratic Oath: an oath of ethics historically taken by doctors, shortened here to the following succinct phrase: first, do no harm

-   The Golden Rule: an ethic that is the basis of a number of religions and cultures: treat others as you would like to be treated

# Spies and Gatekeepers

-   Learn how you fit into the roles of spy and gatekeeper for your company

we can highlight some important points:

-   We should never attempt to obtain information without the permission of the information holder.

-   We should never attempt to obtain information for the benefit of another party.

-   We should never attempt to obtain information using deceitful means.

As a manager, you need to act as a gatekeeper. You have to:

-   Decide what parties should hear information.

-   Decide when that information should be shared.

-   Decide how that information should be framed.

there are two rules that you should abide by when it comes to dealing with all information. Both are simple, and both have been around longer than we’ve been on this planet.

-   The Hippocratic Oath: an oath of ethics historically taken by doctors, shortened here to the following succinct phrase: first, do no harm

-   The Golden Rule: an ethic that is the basis of a number of religions and cultures: treat others as you would like to be treated

Perhaps, we could sort information into three categories:

-   Completely confidential: Aside from those that have been given authority to know, nobody else should. For example, a round of redundancies would fall into this category. This information is not shared.

-   Closed box: Think of it like a present under the Christmas tree. You all know it’s there, but you don’t know what’s in it. The process or concept isn’t sensitive, but the contents are. For example, people will know that pay reviews are being done, but they won’t know each other’s pay, nor will individuals know until the process is finished. This information requires you to filter and gatekeep it.

-   Open box: This information isn’t sensitive at all, such as which staff are in each team. This information can be shared widely.

You should only share information with a person if:

-   It is relevant to them and their job.

-   It benefits you both, such as it unlocks further conversations.

-   You only share what they need to know.

-   They can be trusted to keep any sensitive information a secret.

# Workplace Politics and how they arise

Politics typically arise because of tension between different types of social structures:

-   The organization chart: This is the most obvious place where politics can occur. It could be a debate between you and your boss about your own interests or a conflict between you and your direct reports. It also manifests in individuals reaching down or up through the organization chart to promote their ideas and increase their influence.

-   Close-knit informal groups: There will always be groups of people who are close to each other and protect each other through friendship, camaraderie, or shared interests. They have no formal power structure in the organization chart, but they lobby and work together.

-   Influential people: Singular influential people, who may have much more say than others because of their tenure, celebrity, or bargaining power can make situations political or difficult to navigate because of the difficulty of building consensus without them.

# Using Politics Positively

Who makes decisions in your organization? Who is influential? Who are the close groups of individuals that think similarly, and who are the rival factions? Identifying this upfront allows you to navigate sensibly through the political landscape and gives you the best chance of knowing who to confer with to build consensus on particular issues and who to approach differently or even avoid.

Once you’re done, set yourself a challenge to introduce yourself to them and begin building some connections. Remember that to have influence and to make an impact, you’ll need to win hearts and minds. You’re connecting with people to meet your colleagues, offer them your support, understand them better, and help them get things done, and vice versa. Positivity and kindness prevail.

# Being yourself

Always be open, transparent, respectfully critical, and clear on where you stand. Have the confidence to be open to being proved wrong and to be accepting if you are. Be open to disagree and commit to initiatives. Never push agendas for the sake of serving only one’s self.

-   To disagree and commit is to state that a group hasn’t achieved consensus on a decision that’s being made, but once the decision is finalized, they’ll commit to following it. This avoids the lack of consensus carrying over beyond the decision boundary, preventing progress.

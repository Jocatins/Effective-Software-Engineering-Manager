# Learning objectives

-   The Eye of Sauron: When deadlines are looming, it feels like the entire company is looking at you and your team. We will discuss what you should do when the Eye of Sauron casts its gaze upon you and what to do after it’s gone.

-   Victims of your own success: As companies succeed and get bigger, it gets more challenging to get work done at the same pace. We’ll look at why and what you can do about it.

-   Scope, resources, and time: When you feel the pinch, these are the three levers that you can pull. We’ll find out how

# Warning Signs

-   Stakeholders show increased interest in your project. You’ll have to bat them away rather than repeatedly ask for them to turn up.
-   Senior members of the business begin to probe into the status of your project at every opportunity, such as when you’re grabbing a coffee in the kitchen or walking down the hallway. You may have never spoken to these people before. Why are they talking to you now? Why is the head of sales so keen to be involved?
-   Your boss, or boss’s boss, is being more direct and intense with the progress of your work.
-   You’re noticing how your upcoming feature is being hyped internally and externally.

There are some principles that can help you through these intense and difficult periods. Try to ensure that you’re applying them daily through your discussions, meetings, and decisions

-   Align the team: When you’re under the Eye, your team will probably know. Utilize the pressure in a positive way: align the team around what they need to achieve, make sure everyone understands how to succeed, and then facilitate them moving toward the goal.
-   Over-communicate: At times of immense pressure, you’ll want to increase the visibility of the team’s work, you’ll want to make it absolutely clear what you’re working on, how you’re progressing, and any key decisions that you’ve had to make.
-   Invite responses and feedback: You can prevent frustration if you open up a clear channel of communication for others to use. Make a chat channel, mailing list, or similar update system so that curious and restless minds have a place to interact.
-   Release frequently: Since your cadence is of utmost importance, ensure that you’re releasing as frequently as possible so that your stakeholders can follow along with your latest builds.
-   Lead from the front: As a leader, you need to set an example for the rest of the team. Put in the work. The hardest projects can become career-defining moments. Own them and be there.
-   Be pragmatic: As dates loom nearer, or as the system continues to ignite, you’ll need to make pragmatic calls on development speed, code quality, and technical debt creation.

Here’s how you can round off a tough project and allow some time to recharge:

-   Celebrate: This is one of the most critical things. The team has worked extra hard, and they’ve met their commitment.

-   Tidy up and clear down technical debt: As the deadline approached, a whole bunch of little shortcuts may have been taken, such as a hack here and a missed unit test there. Put aside the next sprint to refactor and tidy up at a more leisurely pace while fixing any production bugs if they arise.

-   Do self-guided project time: Time can also be put aside in the coming weeks for some self-directed learning. Allow the team time to experiment and learn something new. This change of pace and direction puts some mental space between the last project and the next one.
-   Reflect: Arrange a project retrospective meeting. It’s a focused way of reflecting on the whole process and discussing what could be handled better next time.
-   Plan and regroup: Take some time to think about what’s next.

# Triple constraint with respect to the project

You have three levers that you can adjust to find the right compromise with new projects. They are scope, resources, and time. Sometimes, you will have flexibility over all of them, and sometimes, you won’t.

-   Scope: The definition of what the project is going to deliver

-   Resources: The number of engineers that you are going to assign

-   Time: The duration that you have to work on it

# Scope

Your engagement point is to cooperate with your product owner to break the product or feature into epics and stories that each deliver tangible added value to your application. This is your backlog. From there, work together to prioritize it.

-   Encourage categorization of features into must, should, could, and won’t. Work labeled as “must” absolutely needs to happen. Anything with the “should” label is important

# Resources

-   Task parallelism: How much of the work in the scope is sequential, and how much can be done in parallel? Two separate services can be developed independently, but iterations of the same service or component cannot.

-   Code vicinity: The last thing you want is multiple engineers all working on top of each other in the same part of the code, causing nasty merge conflicts with their commits.

-   Technical difficulty: Is this looking like a business-as-usual increment of functionality in your existing application, or is this a new innovative piece of architecture? This drives decisions about which of your staff might be required to work on it, or at least offer their time to oversee it.

# Time#

what can you do if it looks like you’re going to run out of time?

-   Investigate that deadline. Work with your product owner, project manager, or whoever decided the deadline to see what it really means to let it slip. Dig deep for what will really happen if the date moves. More often than not, it’s possible to shift it.

-   If all else fails, pull your other levers. If the deadline can’t be moved, you’ll need to revisit the scope and resources. It’s either that or acquiring Bernard’s watch. (Bernard’s Watch was a British children’s drama about a boy with a pocket watch that, when pressed, would stop time but leave him unaffected. It’s the most prized artifact in software engineering.)

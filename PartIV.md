# Performance Improvement Plan

what is a PIP? In short, it’s a formal document outlining:

-   The current situation and performance issues that are occurring
-   A number of goals that the employee will need to meet in order to pass the PIP and retain their employment and good standing at the company
-   A fixed period of time during which the PIP is active. If they complete all of the goals during that period, they have passed. If not, the consequence is usually that they lose their job.
-   How you are going to help them turn it around

a PIP is not firing in advance

You must be committed to structuring the document and process in a way that actually gives your employee the chance to achieve the goals that have been set and that enables a clear understanding of why those goals are a signifier of good performance.

# Guidelines to prepare the PIP

Outline the employee’s current job description for clarity.

Consider the performance or behavioral issue that you are seeing. You should provide evidence that backs up your claims, referring to the job description. For example, if their work is not up to the required standard, how are you able to show that? Are they missing deadlines? Is bad code being deployed to production regularly? Have there been any formally reported behavioral incidents? Remember that you need evidential claims, not just speculation. Is there evidence that you have spoken to them before about it? Check your one-on-one notes.

Consider goals that you could set for the employee to pass the PIP. Given that you have evidence to demonstrate that their performance is not to the standard that you expect, what does the inverse look like? That is, what would prove good performance? Perhaps, it could be particular pieces of work being completed in a set amount of time, exhibiting particular communication patterns, always turning up on time, and so on. Ensure that each goal is achievable, relevant to their performance, and can be done in a specified amount of time.

Consider whether training or support is required to reach the goals. Each employee should be able to achieve the goals, so if they lack the skills to do so, why is that, and how can you support them?

Consider their personal situation. Sometimes, poor performance happens as a side-effect of issues in a person’s personal life. This is normal, and you should be thoughtful and caring. However, it cannot go on indefinitely. You can make reasonable adjustments to support them, for instance, changing their hours.

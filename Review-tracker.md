# Review-tracker

Here’s what each of the columns means:

-   Staff: The names of each of your staff that you’ll be reviewing. Simple.

-   Form shared: Each cell is marked “yes” when you’ve created and shared the blank review template form that we’ll be looking at in the next section with each member of your staff.

-   Mine filled in: Each cell is marked “yes” when you’ve written all of the relevant sections in the review form that you have to for that member of staff.

-   Theirs filled in: This cell is marked “yes” when the member of staff has completed writing their sections of the same form. Since it’ll be a shared document, you’ll see when they’re done.

-   Peer feedback 1–5: These cells should start out red since you haven’t sent the peer feedback yet. However, you’ll be identifying up to five members of staff for each of your reports that will be sent peer feedback requests for them. You’ll change the color to green when you’ve received it back.

-   Meeting booked: When you’ve got the performance review booked into the calendar, you’ll mark this as “yes.”

-   Peer feedback collated: When all of the peer feedback is in for each staff member, you’ll copy it all into a single document for them to review, and mark this “yes.”

-   Goals: After the review has finished, you’ll mutually agree to the goals that they will be working on for the next six-month period. Guess what, after you’re done, you’ll mark it “yes.”

# Peer feedback emails

Template to be used

Hello,

If you’re receiving this email, it’s because I would love to get some peer feedback on **\_\_\_**. I’ve selected you because you either work very closely with this person or you are managed by them. Ideally, I’d like this feedback in the next two weeks.

Peer feedback is an extremely insightful tool for people during their reviews. Typically, the content of a review between a member of staff and their line manager shouldn’t be too surprising. However, really interesting data comes from others in the organization, as the reviewee can form a fuller picture of how they’re performing in their role. I’d like you to try your best to answer the following questions:

Just replying to this email is fine with me.

# The review form

The review form is broadly split into three parts:

-   Your own observations about what your staff member has achieved and areas they should seek to develop next: You fill this in before the review so they can read it.

-   Your direct report’s observations on the same topics: They fill this in before the review so you can read it.

-   The goals that you have mutually agreed upon for the coming six months: You think about these going into the review and discuss them during it. You finalize them afterward.

# How to split the meeting

-   A reflective discussion about the period that has just passed

-   A forward-thinking discussion about the future

-   A collaborative session drafting goals that they can achieve

In the first two parts, keep the discussion loose and let them do the talking. Ask questions and nudge them along to explore how they feel. Try not to presuppose or suggest too much.

here are some leading questions that you could ask in reference to the content of the written review form:

-   What is it about that achievement that made you feel so proud? Do you feel like that often, or was this a unique occasion?

-   You’ve mentioned that you want to develop that particular area. How do you think you can do that, and how can I support you in doing so?

-   How do you feel about your team? Who in particular do you most like working with? Is there anyone that you find harder to work with? Why is that?

-   How challenging is the work that you’re doing now compared to the last few years? Are you getting enough opportunities to stretch yourself and to learn new things?

-   How does your current role compare to where you predicted you’d be five years ago? Why is that?

-   What do you think of my performance as your manager? What can I do to support you and the team better?

Keep the thought bubble over their head.

During the last third of the review, begin drafting some goals for the next six months together. You don’t need to complete them in the review, but you should begin the thought process collaboratively

you could prompt the conversation by asking:

-   What’s one thing at the company that you would love to work on?
-   Is there anyone here that you look up to, and what traits do they have?
-   How can you increase your impact in your work and in your relationships with your colleagues?
-   What could you achieve in the near future that would make you feel proud?

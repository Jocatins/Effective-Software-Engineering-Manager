# Phases of startups

-   Co-founders: This is where the people with the initial idea create a business and get started. Unless you’re one of the founders yourself, you won’t be concerned with this stage. The co-founders will be looking for a problem-solution fit. They ask is it possible to build a product that solves some business problem? Typically, this results in building a minimum viable product (MVP) to see if customers purchase it and what they can learn from them. Most, if not all, input at this stage will be from the co-founders.

-   Initial investment: If the initial MVP gains traction and looks like it may become a viable business, startups seek initial investment, so they can begin to grow faster than they could organically. This initial investment can come from angel investors, who are typically wealthy businesspeople, startup accelerators, specialized investment funds, and more. It’s enough money to see whether increased investment in the product can increase its impact on the market. A big chance here is to get involved as manager number one. We’ll talk about that shortly.

-   VC rounds: Assuming a startup’s product continues to do well, the company may decide to take on even more investment to keep growing faster and faster. VCs are private equity investors that grow their funds by investing in fast-growing businesses. During these stages, a number of opportunities can arise because that money allows many more engineers to be hired, teams to be created, and possibly even positions to be created that allow you to run multiple teams.

-   Beyond: Once a company grows beyond the VC stages, it’s probably beginning to get as big as many other big companies!

# Becoming manager number one

One of the biggest career growth opportunities for managers is becoming the first manager.

By management, we don’t just mean people management either. We mean managing the process, hiring, communication, and delivery, basically the person that keeps the wheels turning efficiently.

You would be expected to do what you’re doing as a manager of a team, but the scope of that role covers the entire department, even if it’s small.

What is this role called? It’s typically given the title of VP of Engineering. If the CTO is creating the product, the VP of Engineering is responsible for creating the engineering organization. Here are some of the things that a VP of Engineering at a startup may be responsible for:

-   Ownership of the delivery process, from technical aspects, such as how to deploy frequently with no downtime, to the way in which releases are communicated to users and to the rest of the company
-   Performance of the engineers, which encompasses line management, one-to-ones, performance reviews, and creation of all of the processes that surround those activities
-   Resourcing and prioritization of projects, which involves asking, “What’s going to get done and in which order, with limited engineers available?”
-   Hiring new engineers, including the creation of the hiring process in the first place, and working out which roles and skill sets are required
-   Keeping the CTO focused on building, which includes anything that doesn’t fall into the examples above that gets in the way of the CTO.
-   Building stuff! Given that the company is so small, it’s unlikely that a startup VP of Engineering isn’t contributing code.

# The right person for the job

# The hierarchy of needs

Let’s look at each level from the bottom up.

-   Physiological: The foundational biological needs of a human, such as water, food, warmth, and rest

-   Safety: Encompassing everything that keeps humans from harm, this includes personal, emotional, and financial security

-   Love and belonging: The connection to family, friends, and intimate relationships

-   Esteem: Concerning recognition, status, importance, and respect, both of one’s self and from others

-   Self-actualization: The realization of one’s full potential through developing unique talents, skills and abilities, and achieving goals

The bottom two layers are referred to as basic needs. The two above are psychological needs. The top of the pyramid includes self-fulfillment needs.

Let’s revisit Maslow’s model but map it to your life at work:

-   Physiological: You want to be paid fairly for what you do and to have some reasonable benefits.

-   Safety: You want job security and a safe working environment.

-   Love and belonging: You want to work with colleagues that you like and that inspire you, and you want to build good relationships with your team and your manager.

-   Esteem: You want to be recognized for what you do, both informally through feedback and formally through your job title and promotions.

-   Self-actualization: You want to be challenged so that you grow and continually expand your skills. You want to feel that there is always somewhere to advance next in your career.

# The Cathedral and the Bazaar

In the cathedral model, software is free and open source, but it is developed by the aforementioned hermit wizards. In the book, the GCC compiler is given as an example. These projects have long release intervals and are controlled tightly by the development team.

In the bazaar model the entire world contributes and opens their development to the public, despite the chaos. They operate under the tenet that “given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow.” There’s less to lose if occasional issues slip out. Linux is described as the poster child for this movement.

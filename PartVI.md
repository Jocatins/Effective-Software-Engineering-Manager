# Learn about the Dunning-Kruger Effect and Imposter Syndrome.

You’re going to deal with two incredibly fun concepts in psychology that will affect people’s opinions and your ability to make decisions.

# Dunning-Kruger effect

A 1999 study by David Dunning and Justin Kruger presented experiments that proved that people tend to hold overly favorable views of their abilities in many social and intellectual domains. Not only does this lead to poor decisions, but it also means that people are unaware that they are making them!

This effect can be seen from both ends of the seniority scale.

-   Poor decisions by junior engineers: High-achieving and confident junior members of staff, notably those who have just graduated with excellent grades, may not have the experience to make considered decisions about engineering in production. Their overconfidence in being able to solve a problem may give a project the green light, only for it all to not work further down the line.

-   Rash decisions by senior staff: They will be too far from the technical details to intuitively know whether a project is achievable or completely intractable.

# Impostor syndrome

It’s possible that high-achieving individuals may not outwardly appear as good as they actually are. This is called impostor syndrome and was noted in a 1978 study. This internal contradiction about one’s ability can result in excellent individuals feeling like they are somehow a fraud, like they are faking it and will soon get found out. This leads to nervousness and a lack of confidence in their own abilities.

it can play out at differing seniority levels:

-   Overly shy junior engineers: High-achieving juniors may observe a lot of smart and senior folks around them and believe that they have absolutely no right to be there and that, in comparison, their ability is poor.

-   Overly cautious senior staff: They forget that many of the things that come totally naturally to them due to experience are through their hard work, not luck. This may turn them inward and make them cautious and risk-averse because they know the devil is always in the details. It may prevent them from speaking out for the risk of being “found out.”

# Dealing with the Dunning-Kruger effect

For junior members of staff Think of coaching. you want to try and make junior staff come to the conclusion that they are overconfident by themselves.
keep the thought bubble over their head while they tackle a problem

For Senior staff You need to pick your battles here
Some personalities may be totally open for a reasoned debate or working it through together on a whiteboard, but others may benefit from discussion being taken online, where some proper research can be done and the results can be presented in a less confrontational format, such as an email or short document.

# Dealing with impostor syndrome

Brilliant junior staff who experience impostor syndrome need to experience repeated success to overcome how they feel. One way of doing this is by pairing them with a senior staff member who is a good mentor and have them work through problems both abstractly and concretely, implementing them together through pair programming.
regular interactions with more senior staff who can show the junior that they’re doing a great job will build their confidence.

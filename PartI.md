# Meeting with your team members

the two main aspects that you want to uncover will emerge best as part of an open conversation

1. You’ll want them to describe what the team is responsible for and what they are currently working on.

2. You’ll also want to invite their opinion about what they like about the team and what is going well compared to what they currently find most challenging and needs improving.

-   How’s your week going?
-   What are you working on at the moment?
-   What was the last thing that the team shipped that you were really proud of?
-   What would you say the team is primarily responsible for?
-   How are your teammates doing?
-   What’s your favorite thing about working here?
-   What about your least favorite?
-   What’s the one thing that nobody wants to speak up about?
-   What’s something that you think I could help you with?

# Have an introductory meeting with your manager

Questions to ask

-   Their opinion of the team and their performance
-   Details about individuals: Are they superstars or struggling?
-   Framing of the current project or workstream: How long have they been doing it? Has it changed much?
-   Thoughts on how best to work with them. You don’t necessarily have to follow this, but another opinion always helps.
-   General advice about how to do your role within the organization

# Intersecting sections

-   Alignment: These are observations or beliefs that you, your team, and your manager all share. For example, you could all observe that everyone is generally happy or that the dev servers seem to break all of the time.

-   Poor communication downward: This is where you and your manager share observations or beliefs, but the team is either unaware or disagrees. For example, both you and your manager observe that the team causes a high number of bugs in production when compared to other teams, but the team themselves are unaware that this is an issue

-   Poor communication upward: This is where you and your team share an observation or belief, but your manager is unaware. For example, both the team and you have observed that they are understaffed for the roadmap that they have committed to, but your manager isn’t aware that they are struggling. For some reason, this problem hasn’t been raised.

-   False beliefs: Here, both your manager and the team have a conflicting observation or belief from your own. This can be especially true if you’re new to the organization and have seen things done differently elsewhere. For example, the team and their manager could think that their deployment process is fine, but you can observe they only release once a month, and it requires a lot of manual effort and often fails.

# managerial activities that you partake in daily into four buckets:

-   Information gathering

-   Decision-making

-   Nudging

-   Being a role model

A manager’s output can be measured by the following equation:

The output of your team + The output of others that you influence
